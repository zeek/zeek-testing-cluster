# This test verifies that persisted configurations lead to a running Zeek
# cluster when starting up agents and controller. We deploy a configuration
# (that gets persisted), verify it runs, then shut down agent and controller,
# bring them back up, and verify that the cluster returns.

# This needs "ps" and "sqlite3" in the controller's container:
controller_cmd "apt-get -q update && apt-get install -q -y --no-install-recommends procps sqlite3"

# Now launch controller and agent in a new Zeek process tree:
docker_exec -d -- controller /usr/local/zeek/bin/zeek -j site/testing/controller-and-agent.zeek

# Give agent time to connect to the controller:
wait_for_instances 1

# Deploy a Zeek cluster and give its nodes time to come up:
cat $FILES/config.ini | zeek_client deploy-config -
wait_for_all_nodes_running || fail "nodes did not end up running"

# Ensure the controller has persisted the deployed configuration:

    || fail "deployed config did not appear in SQL"

# Shut the whole thing down by killing the Supervisor -- it's the only process
# in "ps ac" output that has no ".<role>" suffix. For example:
#
# $ ps xc | grep zeek
# 2394357 pts/14   Sl+    0:07 zeek <-- Supervisor
# 2394358 pts/14   S      0:00 zeek.stem
# 2394368 pts/14   Sl     0:51 zeek.controller
# ...

# Wait until there are no more Zeek processes

# Now start the whole thing up again:
docker_exec -d -- controller /usr/local/zeek/bin/zeek -j site/testing/controller-and-agent.zeek

# Collect additional output in case of failure, which is otherwise hard to troubleshoot:
wait_for_instances 1 || fail "agent/controller restart failed"

# We should have staged and deployed configs:
zeek_client get-config >output.staged
zeek_client get-config --deployed >output.deployed

# And, we should have a cluster:
zeek_client get-nodes | tee output.zc.nodes | $SCRIPTS/jq-canonify-nodestate >output.nodes
